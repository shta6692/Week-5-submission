## NYPD Shooting Incident Data Report

We analyzed NY Shooting data by using a website (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset). The dataset is titled NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic). 
Especially number of incident of each year by each borough were analysed.
The steps we did are as follows.

Step1: Start an Rmd Document
 We Created an RMD document in R Studio.

Step2.Tidy and Transform Your Data
 The number of occurrences for each year was totaled for each borough (STATEN ISLAND, BRONX, BROOLKLYN, MANHATTAN, QUEENS) regarding NYPD shooting Incident data. 
 Specifically, we filtered the original data by the borough.
 And the year part of Occurred Date was cut out from the original data and aggregated for each year.
 See below programming for details.

Step 3: Add Visualizations and Analysis
 The aggregated results for each borough were summarized, and then regression analysis was performed.
 The table below are aggregated results for each borough for number of incident.
 
 |Borough      |Max|Min|Mean|
 |-----        |---|---|----|
 |Staten Island|69.9|25.0|46.4|
 |Bronx        |571.0|267.0|446.7|
 |Brooklyn     |850.0|357.0|648.9|
 |Manhattan    |288.0|105.0|194.8|
 |Queens       |326.0|144.0|235.5|
 
 As a result of regression analysis, all borough (STATEN ISLAND, BRONX, BROOLKLYN, MANHATTAN, QUEENS) from 2006 to 2020,
 the slope is negative, and it can be said that the number of shootings incident is on the decline.
 See the graph for each subsequent borough.


Step 4: Add Bias Identification
 This analysis is analyzed using data from 2006 to 2020. The data for 2020 are far from the straight line graph in every region.
 Therefore, it is a downward trend before 2020, but when the data after 2021 are aggregated
 It may rise, so further analysis is needed.
